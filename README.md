# Binary Sreach Tree | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List - Implementation in C++



## *Data Structures* Repository includes following data structures, Implemented in C++:
- Binary Search Tree
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

###### [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/hmzeeshantariq/Data_Structures)
This implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) is done in C++. The repository includes both the [Header](./BST.h) as well as [Implementation](./BST.cpp) files. The code is fully operational and easily comprehensilbe.

###### [Singly Linked List](https://github.com/hmzeeshantariq/Data_Structures)
This repository includes a generic implementation of Sinlgy linked list using template in C++. The repository includes both the [Header](./singlyLinkedList.h) as well as [Implementation](./singlyLinkedList.cpp) files. It is complele implementation and quite simple.

###### [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/hmzeeshantariq/Data_Structures)
Here we have generic implementation of Doubly linked list using template in C++. The repository includes both the [Header](./doublyLinkedList.h) as well as [Implementation](./doublyLinkedList.cpp) files. The implementation is impeccable.

***Just pull the repo & you're Good to go !***
